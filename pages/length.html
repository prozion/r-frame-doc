<h2>Length of an Object</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Get or set the length of vectors (including lists) and factors, and of
any other <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object for which a method has been defined.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
length(x)
length(x) &lt;- value
</pre>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>an <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> object.  For replacement, a vector or factor.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td><code>value</code></td>
<td>
<p>a non-negative integer or double (which will be rounded down).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Both functions are generic: you can write methods to handle specific
classes of objects, see InternalMethods.  <code>length&lt;-</code> has a
<code>"factor"</code> method.
</p>
<p>The replacement form can be used to reset the length of a vector.  If
a vector is shortened, extra values are discarded and when a vector is
lengthened, it is padded out to its new length with <code>NA</code>s
(<code>nul</code> for raw vectors).
</p>
<p>Both are primitive functions.
</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>The default method for <code>length</code> currently returns a non-negative
<code>integer</code> of length 1, except for vectors of more than
<i>2^31 - 1</i> elements, when it returns a double.
</p>
<p>For vectors (including lists) and factors the length is the number of
elements.  For an environment it is the number of objects in the
environment, and <code>NULL</code> has length 0.  For expressions and
pairlists (including language objects and dotlists) it is the
length of the pairlist chain.  All other objects (including functions)
have length one: note that for functions this differs from S.
</p>
<p>The replacement form removes all the attributes of <code>x</code> except its
names, which are adjusted (and if necessary extended by <code>""</code>).
</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>Package authors have written methods that return a result of length
other than one (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Formula"><span class="pkg">Formula</span></a>) and that return a vector of type
<code>double</code> (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix"><span class="pkg">Matrix</span></a>), even with non-integer values
(earlier versions of <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sets"><span class="pkg">sets</span></a>).  Where a single double value is
returned that can be represented as an integer it is returned as a
length-one integer vector.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
length(diag(4))  # = 16 (4 x 4)
length(options())  # 12 or more
length(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3)  # 3
length(expression(x, {y &lt;- x^2; y+2}, x^y))  # 3

## from example(warpbreaks)
require(stats)

fm1 &lt;- lm(breaks ~ wool * tension, data = warpbreaks)
length(fm1$call)      # 3, lm() and two arguments.
length(formula(fm1))  # 3, ~ lhs rhs
