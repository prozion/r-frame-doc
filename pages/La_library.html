LAPACK Library
</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Report the name of the shared object file with <code>LAPACK</code> implementation
in use.
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre>
La_library()
</pre>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>A character vector of length one (<code>""</code> when the name is not known).
The value can be used as an indication of which <code>LAPACK</code>
implementation is in use.  Typically, the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> version of <code>LAPACK</code> will
appear as <code>libRlapack.so</code> (<code>libRlapack.dylib</code>), depending on how
R was built.  Note that <code>libRlapack.so</code> (<code>libRlapack.dylib</code>) may
also be shown for an external <code>LAPACK</code> implementation that had been
copied, hard-linked or renamed by the system administrator.  Otherwise,
the shared object file will be given and its path/name may indicate
the vendor/version.  The detection does not work on Windows.
</p>
<h3>See Also</h3>
<p><code>extSoftVersion</code> for versions of other third-party software
including <code>BLAS</code>.
</p>
<p><code>La_version</code> for the version of LAPACK in use.
