<h2>
Lists of Open/Active Graphics Devices
</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A pairlist of the names of open graphics devices is stored in
<code>.Devices</code>. The name of the active device (see
<code>dev.cur</code>) is stored in <code>.Device</code>.  Both are symbols
and so appear in the base namespace.
</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p><code>.Device</code> is a length-one character vector.
</p>
<p><code>.Devices</code> is a pairlist of length-one character vectors.
The first entry is always <code>"null device"</code>, and there are as many
entries as the maximal number of graphics devices which have been
simultaneously active.  If a device has been removed, its entry will be
<code>""</code> until the device number is reused.
</p>
<p>Devices may add attributes to the character vector: for example
devices which write to a file may record its path in attribute
<code>"filepath"</code>.
